== Welcome to HighFive

HighFive is an application built to keep score for photo contests on flickr. HighFive will find all photos with the tags specified in the configuration file, and then score each user. HighFive supports moderation by a flickr user whose username is specified in the configuration file. This moderator may up or down mod each individual photo by commenting on it with things like [+1] to add one point or [-2] to subtract two points.

== Getting Started

1. Setup config/config.yml with your flickr api key, a tag, and a moderator username 
2. Run rake highfive:score to populate your database with Users, Photos, and Comments
3. Setup a cron job on your server to call update_scores.sh periodically to update the applications data
